Beginning February 2019, I'm a postdoctoral research associate working with Prof. Herbert Levine [Herbert Levine](http://www.bioe.neu.edu/people/levine-herbert) at Northeastern University. Here you can find my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0fl1yhye8zwfcjq/CHW_CV.pdf?dl=0). Also check out my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/chinghao0703) for some eclectic codes I wrote.

**06/07/2018**
New manuscript titled "*Pinned, locked, pushed, and pulled traveling waves in structured environments*" is on [arXiv:1806.02480](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02480) and [bioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/341222) now!

**03/23/2018**
A bunch of physicists including myself just finished a review titled "*A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists*." We also made 20 [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to showcase the ideas introduced in the main text. Check out [arXiv:1803.08823](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08823) and the accompanying [website](http://physics.bu.edu/~pankajm/MLnotebooks.html) for more details.

### Research ###

Generally speaking, I'm interested in applying statistical physics to understand how collective behavior of matters emerges. I also have a running interest in machine learning, optimization, and statistics. In the past, I did some condensed matter physics (ranging from the strongly correlated physics and nonlinear dynamics of ultra-cold atoms to the Ginzburg-Landu theory of liquid-solid interfacial dynamics), but now I focus more on biological systems. For details, check out my [Research](https://chinghao0703.github.io/Research/) page.
