I'm a biophyscist/computational scientist/biologist based in Cambridge, MA. Here you can find my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4qdzrujpdiqe96l/CHW_CV.pdf?dl=0). Here is my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-ylxpYAAAAJ&hl=en). Also check out my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/chinghao0703) for some eclectic codes I wrote. 



### News ###

**[05]** 
I have implemented (using PyMC3) a **Bayesian inference procedure of COVID-19 antibody tests with unknown specificity and sensitivity** following [Gelman & Carpenter proposa](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/specificity.pdf). Data can be found in the famous but (potentially) wrongly analyzed study by Bendavid et al. titled [COVID-19 Antibody Seroprevalence in Santa Clara County, California](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.14.20062463v2). For details, see my [repo](https://github.com/chinghao0703/Bayesian-Inference-covid-antibody-test).


**[05/13/2019]**
New manuscript titled "**Constrained optimization as ecological dynamics with applications to random quadratic programming in high dimensions**" is officially published at [Physical Review E](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.99.052111). See also my [blogpost](https://chinghao0703.github.io/Recent-research-update/) for an intro/preivew. 

**[04/15/2019]**
New paper titled "**Pinned, locked, pushed, and pulled traveling waves in structured environments**" is published now at [Theoretical Population Biology](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tpb.2019.04.003)!

**[04/01/2019]**
The published verision of our machine leanring review titled "**A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists**" is out (still open-access) at [Physics Reports](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physrep.2019.03.001). Also check out the [Python Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/drckf/mlreview_notebooks) that come with it.

**[11/13/2018]**
New manuscript titled "**The strength of protein-protein interactions controls the information capacity and dynamical response of signaling networks**" is on [arXiv:1811.05371](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05371) and [bioRxiv:10.1101/469197](https://doi.org/10.1101/469197) now!




### Research ###

Generally speaking, I'm interested in applying statistical physics to understand how collective behavior of matters emerges. I also have a running interest in machine learning, optimization, and statistics. In the past, I did some condensed matter physics (ranging from the strongly correlated physics and nonlinear dynamics of ultra-cold atoms to the Ginzburg-Landu theory of liquid-solid interfacial dynamics), but now I focus more on biological systems. For details, check out my [Research](https://chinghao0703.github.io/Research/) page.
