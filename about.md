I'm a biophyscist/computational biologist based in Boston, MA. Here you can find my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0fl1yhye8zwfcjq/CHW_CV.pdf?dl=0) and [Résumé](https://www.dropbox.com/s/u47ag9gug3add92/Resume_WANG.pdf?dl=0). Here is my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-ylxpYAAAAJ&hl=en). Also check out my GitHub [repository](https://github.com/chinghao0703) for some eclectic codes I wrote. 


### SCOTUS justices voting pattern ###
Curious about the SCOTUS voting pattern? Shown below is the correlation matrix of Justices in the Roberts' court (excludinng J.P. Stevens and S.D. O'Connor since they have less overlap with currently sitting justices) constructed based all cases documented in the [SCOTUS database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/). Check out the Python Jupyter notebook [here](https://chinghao0703.github.io/Research/) for more details.

### Research ###

Generally speaking, I'm interested in applying statistical physics to understand how collective behavior of matters emerges. I also have a running interest in machine learning, optimization, and statistics. In the past, I did some condensed matter physics (ranging from the strongly correlated physics and nonlinear dynamics of ultra-cold atoms to the Ginzburg-Landu theory of liquid-solid interfacial dynamics), but now I focus more on biological systems. For details, check out my [Research](https://chinghao0703.github.io/Research/) page.
