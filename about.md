I'm a biophyscist/computational scientist/biologist based in Cambridge, MA. Here you can find my [CV](assets/CHW_CV.pdf). Here is my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_-ylxpYAAAAJ&hl=en). 



### Research ###

Generally speaking, I'm interested in applying statistical physics to understand how collective behavior of matters emerges. I also have a running interest in machine learning, optimization, and statistics. In the past, I did some condensed matter physics (ranging from the strongly correlated physics and nonlinear dynamics of ultra-cold atoms to the Ginzburg-Landu theory of liquid-solid interfacial dynamics), but now I focus more on biological systems.
