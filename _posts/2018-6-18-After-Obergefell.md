title: After Obegerfell
---

To keep the momentum going, here’s one tiny piece that I intend to post as a follow-up to the previous blog post. Disclaimer again: I’m just here blogging about my opinion based on my limited legal knowledge which I don’t even purport to comprehend fully. For this reason, I encourage readers to check out other professional treatises to complement my viewpoint.

Acute readers might have noticed that the majority opinion penned by Justice Kennedy in *Obergefell* seems to recognize but dodge some legal questions about Equal Protection. Indeed, critics have said that Justice Kenney's opinion is light on legal analysis and heavier on social policies. For some, this might be troublesome since the Supreme Court is, unlike every other court in the United States, kind of a “policy-making” institution, given that it has often been wrapped in the garb of many high-profile cases that set the constitutional rules for the entire country. As a scientist dabbles in this legal issue, I think the Court established a fundamental right to marriage based on two critical rationales. First, it held that marriage is a fundamental right due to the following four characteristics, that marriage is critical to individual autonomy, that it is critical to support a two-person union unlike any others, that it affords the permanency and stability essential to children’s interests, and that it is keystone to our social order. Then the Court went on to expatiate the invariance of these characteristics across same-sex and opposite-sex couples.

  > The limitation of marriage to opposite-sex couples may long have seemed natural and just, but its inconsistency with the central meaning of the fundamental right to marry is now manifest.

Second, it tacks on an Equal Protection analysis to establish that by not extending such institution of marriage to same-sex couples, the law de facto demeans them.

  > It is demeaning to lock same-sex couples out of a central institution of the Nation’s society, for they too many aspire to the transcendent purposes of marriage.

Such fundamental right argument is perhaps the part of the opinion that have elicited many strictures. People criticize the first rationale since decreeing something as a fundamental right is sometimes unfavorable under the Due Process jurisprudence. Indeed, in *Washington v. Glucksberg*, the Court said that fundamental rights should be defined very narrowly and meticulously. 

  > As we stated recently in Flores, the Fourteenth Amendment "forbids the government to infringe ... 'fundamental' liberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided, unless the infringement is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest." 507 U. S., at 302.

With such precedent, some argued that Justice Kennedy’s opinion wasn’t that careful and narrow. For the second part, some even find it more dissatisfying because one would typically set up a level of scrutiny to conduct judicial reviews, which in this case, Equal Protection analysis. Laws that are subject only to rational basis scrutiny are usually upheld while those to intermediate or strict scrutiny are often struck down. In Obergefell, the Court didn’t articulate the appropriate level of scrutiny for discrimination against same-sex couples; therefore, it opened doors to future litigations on many unanswered questions.

[ I do not think the Court's opinion dictates the result of many such cases, for example, whether the fundamental right to marry extends to polygamy, which the Justice Kennedy went to great length to reason why it doesn't.]
