title: SCOTUS voting patterns
---

Here I compare the voting pattern of justices in the Rehnquist (1986 to 2005) and/or Roberts court (2005 to present). This data is publicly available at [SCOTUS database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/) provided by the Washington University of Law. On top of this dataset, I annotated the justices with party of the president by whom they were appointed to the bench. More details to come.
