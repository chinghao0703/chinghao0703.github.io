title: SCOTUS voting patterns
---

Here I compare the voting pattern of justices in ther Roberts' court (2005 to present). This data is publicly available at [SCOTUS database](http://scdb.wustl.edu/) provided by the Washington University of Law. On top of this dataset, I annotated the justices with party of the president by whom they were appointed to the bench.  You can find the [Python Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/chinghao0703/chinghao0703.github.io/blob/master/SCOTUS/notebooks/SCOTUS-voting-correlation.ipynb) and its [html](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wteg0uoc4m9bp7x/SCOTUS-voting-correlation.html?dl=0) verion used to generate these figures  here. More detailed analysis and interpretation to come.
