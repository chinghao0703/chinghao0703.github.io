### Ongoing projects ###

* **Statistical mechanical design of cellular computations**

   One of the amazing things about living cells is their ability to respond to changing environments. It is known that this process, often dubbed signaling, is coordinated by networks of molecules such as proteins that operate on the relay of post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, etc.). Indeed, signaling bears close similarities with the conventional silicon-based computation in which signal inputs are related to outputs (i.e., I-O relation) through digital circuitry. In this project, we undertake to codify this connection through a statistical mechanical characterization of signaling protein interaction. We develop a novel theoretical framework that allows us to relate molecular interactions to I-O relation. Built on this, we design an algorithm which would enable bioengineers to rationally design synthetic networks to implement desired computation. (manuscript in preparation)

### Things I still have a running interest in ###

* **Statistical physics of energy expenditure in biology**
* **Range expansion in ecology and evolution**

    Invasions and range expansions are common ecological processes that often fundamentally transform affected communities. We show that the properties of invasions are remarkably different depending on whether space and time are continuous or discrete. Discrete models describe seasonal growth and fragmented habitats, while continuous models are appropriate when there is little temporal and spatial variation. Our main result is that, in discrete models, the expansions can proceed periodically in a step-like or pulsed fashion with velocities locked into specific values. In locked expansions, small changes in migration or growth either have no effect on the invasion rate or lead to a discontinuous jump in the expansion velocity and alter the periodicity of front pulsations. As a result, the evolution and response to perturbations in locked expansions could be markedly different compared to the expectations based on continuous models. Velocity locking occurs only when both space and time are discrete and further requires an Allee effect, i.e. an increase in the growth rate with density due to intraspecific facilitation or other factors. When Allee effects are negligible, expansions proceed in the standard smooth fashion for both discrete and continuous models. In sum, pushed but not pulled expansions can become locked. 



### When I was a condensed matter theorist ###

* **Ginzburg-Landau theory of bcc-liquid interfacial kinetics:**

    A major determinant of the morphology of crystals grown from the melt far from local thermodynamic equilibrium is the solid-liquid interface kinetic coefficient. Extending the standard equilibrium Ginzburg-Landau framework, we incorporate a thermodynamic driving force proportional to the undercooling and a free-energy dissipation time scale that is related to the inverse half-width of the dynamic equilibrium structure factor to derive the kinetic coefficient explicitly. We contrast our result with previous linear analytic approximation and that obtained by MD simulation. We also used our theory to derive an inverse relation between the kinetic coefficient and the solid-liquid interfacial free-energy. The general methodology used here also applies to amplitude equations derived from the phase-field-crystal model, which only differ from GL theory by the choice of cubic and higher-order nonlinearities in the free-energy density.
    
* **Semiclassical impurity scattering of matter wave solitons**  

    One of the most fundamental differences between classical and quantum mechanics is observed in the particle tunneling through a localized potential: the former predicts a discontinuous transmission coefficient (T) as a function in incident velocity between one (complete penetration) and zero (complete reflection), while the later always changes smoothly as a wave nature. Here we report a systematic study of the quantum tunneling property for a bright soliton in ultracold atoms, which behaves as a classical particle (matter wave) in the limit of small (large) incident velocity. In the intermediate regime, the classical and quantum properties are combined via a finite (but not full) discontinuity in the tunneling transmission coefficient. We demonstrate that the formation of a localized bound state is essential to describe such inelastic collisions, showing a nontrivial nonlinear effect on the quantum transportation of a bright soliton.
