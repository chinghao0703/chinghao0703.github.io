### Ongoing projects ###

* **Statistical mechanical design of cellular computations**

   One of the amazing things about living cells is their ability to respond to changing environments. It is known that this process, often dubbed signaling, is coordinated by networks of molecules such as proteins that operate on the relay of post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, methylation, etc.). Indeed, signaling bears close similarities with the conventional silicon-based computation in which signal inputs are related to outputs (i.e., I-O relation) through digital circuitry. In this project, we undertake to codify this connection through a statistical mechanical characterization of signaling protein interaction. We develop a novel theoretical framework that allows us to relate molecular interactions to I-O relation. Built on this, we design an algorithm which would enable bioengineers to rationally design synthetic networks to implement desired computation. (manuscript in preparation)


* **Biophysical constraints on biochemical signaling**
* **Trade-offs in biophysical inference of the environments**
* **Decoding the temporal dynamics of biochemical signaling with machine learning**



### Things I still have a running interest in ###

* **Statistical physics of energy expenditure in biology**
* **Range expansion in ecology and evolution**
